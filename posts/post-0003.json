  "title": "Database Sharding Strategy for User Service",
  "description": "User database has reached 50M records and query performance is degrading. Proposal to implement horizontal sharding:\n\n**Proposed Approach:**\n- Shard by user_id hash (16 shards initially)\n- Use consistent hashing for distribution\n- Implement shard-aware connection pooling\n- Add read replicas per shard\n\n**Challenges Identified:**\n- Cross-shard queries need aggregation layer\n- Migration requires careful planning (zero downtime)\n- Application changes needed in 8 microservices\n\n**Performance Goals:**\n- Query latency < 100ms (p95)\n- Support 100M users\n- 10x write throughput improvement\n\nArchitect2 has submitted initial design document with detailed implementation phases. Pending admin review before moving to implementation.",
